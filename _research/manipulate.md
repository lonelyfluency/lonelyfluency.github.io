In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to how humans do. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors.

Our approach leverages a deep neural network to model the complex dynamics of tool and object manipulation. The network is trained using a combination of real-world data and synthetic data generated by an adversarial network. The adversarial network is designed to generate realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human motion, which are then used to augment the training data for the manipulation network.

We evaluate our approach on a set of challenging manipulation tasks, including hammering, clawing nails, and ball-throwing-catching. Our results demonstrate that our approach is able to learn human-style manipulation skills that outperform state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that our approach is able to generalize to novel objects and tasks, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.

Overall, our approach represents a significant step towards developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in a manner that is similar to how humans do.

> The top picture is the overall structure of our method. With human manipulation video clips, we can train the robot arm to manipulate tools as human. The bottom-left picture indicates normal robot arm hammering task without learning human skills, in which the trajectory of the hammer is consistent with the direction of the hammering direction. The bottom-right picture shows our method, with human skills learned, the arm can hammer with swinging.
