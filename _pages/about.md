## Academic

I have some research experience in several fields(Each has been at least a main focus of one semester). But my true love is in robotics<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

- Performance optimization for neural networks.
  - Focused on neural network pruning and down-sampling in [Shanghai Jiao Tong Advanced Computer Architecture Lab](http://acalab.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Teacher.aspx?infolb=3&flag=3)
- Inverse reinforcement learning of driving behavior
  - Conducted projects in [Berkeley Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/research/autonomous-vehicle.html)
- Motion control of legged robotics
  - Published a little [paper](https://yangcyself.github.io/publication/HexpodPaper) of RL with a hexapod


## Open Source Community

I am proficient at developing in python and good at C/C++ and MATLAB. I think I am quite experienced in both system and scientific programming. (I became interested in OCaml after taking *Design and Analysis of Programming Languages*)

I will be very happy to contribute to Open Source projects, but I haven't found one.
