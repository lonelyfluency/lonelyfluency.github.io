## Academic

I am currently a PhD student under marie-sklodowska-curie-actions [RAICAM](http://raicam.eu/) in FORTH. My undergraduate and master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University is Automation & Control Engineering. My research interest is about legged robots. I am currently in [CVRL-FORTH](https://www.ics.forth.gr/cvrl/). I was in [RL2 Lab](https://gaoyue.sjtu.edu.cn) of the AI Institute of SJTU. I am doing research about legged robots on the following topics:

- Locomotion planning and control for legged robots.
  
- Reinforcement learning based motion control for legged robots. 

- Traverse capability based path planning for legged robots.

- Multi-legged modular robotic platform.

## Teaching

I am currently a teaching assistant at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Crete.

I had a part-time job as an informatics competition coach in Shanghai Jiao Long Academy in the past. My job is to teach middle school students classical algorithms and programming in Python/C++ to participate in informatics competitions.

## Open Source Community

I am proficient at developing in python and good at C/C++ and ROS. I will be very happy to contribute to Open Source projects about robot perception, planning and control.
